This programs help you to send a few gro to another lightning node without the necessity to
have the other node issuing an invoice first.

It is achieved by an idea explained in this video: https://youtu.be/Dwl-0cY6KkU
The key is that `getroute` finds a route to the designated route which is then appeneded by its
reverse path so that there is a fully circular payment. Finally you issue an invoice of one gro
and pay the invoice with the `sendpay` command and the modified route. While paying yourself you
leave a ridiculous high fee at the node which you wanted to pay without invoice.

Obviously you don't have to do this with a circular payment but you could also pay a small invoice
to your friend Alice and find a route over the "real" recipient

These payments are even more anonymous as the reciepient will just believe it routed a payment.

use the tool by `$ python3.6 pay_without_invoice.py node_id amount_in_satoshi`.`
